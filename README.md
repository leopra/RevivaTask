# PROBLEM: SALES TAXES
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and
medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all
imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price
(including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes
paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%.
